Common Query Language parser in JavaScript
==========================================

A hand-written, recursive descent parser of the Common Query Language as
used in the standardized information retrieval protocols - SRU/W.

The parser can be used in places where the front-end query analysis is 
required (e.g search UIs, etc).

CQL specification, including the grammar and detailed description of the
language: [CQL specs](http://www.loc.gov/standards/sru/specs/cql.html)
